#Predict:Blood Donation (DrivenData)
This dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus. I've done preprocessing , feature engineering and applying different algorithms and further ensembling it to make a more robust model.
